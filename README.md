# Rotated-Frame-Generator
Python script to create a vertical strip of frames of a dial rotated through a customisable range of motion.

The four parameters at the top of the script allow you to specify the file path, range of motion, and number of frames.

While creating a custom rotary slider for one of my plugins, I needed a way to create all the frames of the slider rotating through its full range of motion. I created this script to generate a vertical strip of these frames, when given a png of the dial in the middle of its range.
